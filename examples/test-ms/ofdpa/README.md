# Running iSDX with OF-DPA switches

In order for iSDX to be truly useful, it must run at line speed on hardware switches.  We
have taken the following steps to demonstrate this.

1. **_Configure three hardware switches in the iSDX multi-switch (MS) configuration as shown
below._**   
The switches we chose are Quanta LY2.  To support iSDX's requirement of OpenFlow
1.3, we installed
[OF-DPA 2.0](http://lumanetworks.github.io/of-dpa/doc/html/d8/dd0/OFDPA_OVERVIEW.html)
running on Open Network Linux.  The switches are connected to
two Linux machines (Dell R630's) via 10GB links as shown.  

 **Current Wiring Configuration**
![Current Wiring Configuration]
(https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Z31EwSiUv8rKb9EqCd8TIS5-N9iTvfsiXOKnah7KToA/pub?w=960&h=720)  
 
2. **_Verify that the types of flow rules generated by iSDX can be supported by OF-DPA on the
Quanta switches._**   
We performed this verification by studying the [OF-DPA documentation]
(https://github.com/Broadcom-Switch/of-dpa/blob/master/OF-DPA-2.0/OFDPA_ASSV-ETP200-R.pdf)
and experimenting with installing flow rules on one of the switches.  iSDX rules require:  
Matching on various combinations of:
 * input port
 * eth_type
 * eth_src
 * eth_dst with arbitrary bit masking
 * TCP dst port
 * TCP src port  

 Actions to:
 * forward to a port
 * set eth_src
 * set eth_dst  

 iSDX originally also used two features that we found are not supported by OF-DPA:
 matching on the ARP_TPA and multicast in concert with setting the eth_dst (for ARP).  To
 work around these limitations, we moved these features to a software switch (OVS) as shown
 in the figure.  

 **OF-DPA Matching**  
 [OF-DPA defines a pipeline of flow tables]
 (https://github.com/Broadcom-Switch/of-dpa/blob/master/OF-DPA-2.0/OFDPA_ASSV-ETP200-R.pdf),
 each of which supports different types of 
 rules.
 (The formal definition of these rules is described [here]
 (https://github.com/Broadcom-Switch/of-dpa/blob/master/OF-DPA-2.0/ofdpa-v2.0.0.2.ttp.json)
 using [OpenFlow Table Type patterns]
 (https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/OpenFlow%20Table%20Type%20Patterns%20v1.0.pdf).)
 Only one of these tables, the Policy ACL table, is relevant to iSDX.  The Policy
 ACL table (table 60) supports matching on the fields listed above, however, it also
 requires that
 all matched packets be VLAN tagged.  The documentation leads one to believe that the VLAN
 table (earlier in the pipeline) must be programmed to add a VLAN tag to untagged traffic;
 however, in practice it appears that a VLAN tag of '1' is added to untagged traffic by
 default and no rules are needed in the VLAN table.

 **OF-DPA Actions**  
 We found that the OF rules generated by iSDX are not directly supported by OF-DPA.  In
 particular, OF-DPA rules cannot directly include actions required by iSDX.
 It is, however, possible to generate equivalent OF rules that OF-DPA *does* support.
 Actions can be placed into an OF group which can then be referenced by rules in the
 Policy ACL table.  For iSDX, there are two relevant types of groups.  An instance of the
 L2 Interface Group holds an output port number, so when a Policy ACL rule needs to
 forward a packet to an output port, the rule references the appropriate L2 Interface
 Group instance.  The L2 Rewrite Group is used to overwrite the MAC src or dst address.
 If a Policy ACL rule needs to overwrite the MAC src or dst address, it references the
 appropriate L2 Rewrite Group instance which in turn references a L2 Interface Group in
 order to forward the modified packet to an output port.

3. **_Test the functionality and performance of the matching and action features described
above using the Quanta switches._**  
For the initial testing, we used the following configuration: 
![Perf Testing
Configuration](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1QHrcgNcjwR5H5EvDLtqaz93rxjewIARrKszlBA7NkNo/pub?w=960&h=720)
On the Quanta switch (ssh in to it via management interface) start the OF-DPA service and
agent.  The agent will try to connect to the Ryu controller, which in our setup is at
`10.0.0.100:6633`.  The datapath ID (`--dpid=1`) uniquely identifies this switch to the controller.  When additional switches are added to the configuration, they will need to use different dpids.
The OF-DPA agent that we run on the switch is `brcm-indigo-ofdpa-agent`.
There is an alternative agent called `indigo-ofdpa-agent`; however, in our experimentation we
found that the latter does not properly handle the ethertype for ARP.
[This forum post]
(https://groups.google.com/a/openflowhub.org/forum/#!msg/floodlight-dev/VA78jF9LYjg/xhccoffDeMoJ)
 briefly discusses the two implementations.
 ````
 # service ofdpa restart
 # sleep 20 	 # delay until service is really up
 # brcm-indigo-ofdpa-ofagent --controller=10.0.0.100:6633 --dpid=1
 ````
On the controller VM, start Ryu with REST interface.  (Make sure to wait until the agent
in the previous step prints a few 'Connection refused' messages.)
 ````
 $ bin/ryu-manager --verbose ryu.app.ofctl_rest
 ````
### Installing Test Flow Rules (and Related Groups)
Use the provided 'ofdpa_*' scripts to set up a test flow.  These scripts use `curl` to send messages
to the Ryu REST interface using the syntax found
[here](http://ryu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/app/ofctl_rest.html).
First, create an L2 Interface Group for port 7.  If a rule references this group, any
packets that match the rule will be sent to port 7.
 ````
 $ ofdpa_add_group_intf 7
 ````
Then create an L2 Rewrite Group that overwrites the dest MAC address and forwards the
packet out on port 7 via the L2 Interface Group.  In this case, the MAC address we are
writing corresponds to the host interface connected to port 7.
 ````
 $ ofdpa_add_group_rewrite 7 44:a8:42:32:5d:59
 ````
Do the same thing for port 8:
 ````bash
 $ ofdpa_add_group_intf 8
 $ ofdpa_add_group_rewrite 8 44:a8:42:32:5d:5b
 ````
Finally, create simple flow rules that forward packets from port 7 to port 8 and from port 8 to
port 7.  These flows rules reference the L2 Interface Groups created above.  (At the moment,
these scripts do not use the L2 Rewrite Groups that we just created.)
 ````
 $ ofdpa_add_flow_basic 7 8
 $ ofdpa_add_flow_basic 8 7
 ````
### Dumping Groups and Rules
You can dump the groups and rules either using commands on the switch or via the OF interface.  
Using commands on the switch:
 ````
 # client_grouptable_dump
 groupId = 0x00010007 (L2 Interface, VLAN ID = 1, Port ID = 7): duration: 171, refCount:2
    bucketIndex = 0: outputPort = 7 popVlanTag = 1 
 groupId = 0x00010008 (L2 Interface, VLAN ID = 1, Port ID = 8): duration: 168, refCount:2
	bucketIndex = 0: outputPort = 8 popVlanTag = 1 
 groupId = 0x10000007 (L2 Rewrite, Index = 7): duration: 159, refCount:0
	bucketIndex = 0: referenceGroupId = 0x00010007 vlanId = 0 srcMac: 00:00:00:00:00:00 dstMac: 44:A8:42:32:5D:59 
 groupId = 0x10000008 (L2 Rewrite, Index = 8): duration: 156, refCount:0
	bucketIndex = 0: referenceGroupId = 0x00010008 vlanId = 0 srcMac: 00:00:00:00:00:00 dstMac: 44:A8:42:32:5D:5B

 ````
Using scripts based on the OF interface:
 ````
 $ ofdpa_show_groups 
"group_id": 65544	    (0x10008)	    "actions": ["OUTPUT:8", "POP_VLAN"]
"group_id": 268435464	(0x10000008)	"actions": ["GROUP:65544", "SET_FIELD: {eth_dst:44:a8:42:32:5d:5b}"]

"group_id": 268435463	(0x10000007)	"actions": ["GROUP:65543", "SET_FIELD: {eth_dst:44:a8:42:32:5d:59}"]

 $ ofdpa_show_flows

"match": {"dl_vlan": "1", "in_port": 8}, "actions": ["GROUP:65543"], "priority": 4, "packet_count": 299
 ````
### Testing End-to-End Functionality and Performance
We created and installed rules of all the different types needed by iSDX -- i.e., rules with
various combinations of matching and actions -- and verified that they worked correctly by
sending traffic through the switch with `ping` and `iperf` (not shown).   
We tested performance with `iperf` as shown below. The client and server `iperf` processes
ran in different containers to force the packets to go through the switch.  We also dumped
the packet counts from the switch to verify that the traffic was truly going through the switch.
Note that the transfer rate is 9.4Gb/s, close to the limit on the 10Gb/s links.

4. **_Port iSDX to the OF-DPA-Based Hardware Configuration_**  
The 'Refmon' (a.k.a. 'flanc', or 'Fabric Manager') component of SDX has been modified to
support OF-DPA based switches and the modified component has been tested the on the Quanta
switches.

 To use SDX with an OF-DPA switch, specify it in the global configuration file.  E.g., the
 following indicates that `main`, `inbound`, and `outbound` are OF-DPA switches:
 ````
    "RefMon Settings" : {
        "fabric options": {
                "ofdpa": ["main", "inbound", "outbound"],
		...
 ````
